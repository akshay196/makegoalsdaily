            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Short term goals are prerequisite to logging activities. And they fall under some category. Application has a default set of categories which could be overridden by creating new set in settings. Description should be comprehensive and complete though it can be updated. Date of completion may be tentative and hence can be updated. Specification of planned hours to be spent per day makes goals measurable. Goals can be updated with notes or remarks. Further goals can be marked as achieved. And may be removed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Daily activities should be logged with the application. Each activity holds mapping with a goal, and this ensures that all our activities are a part of our goals. Activity should have a short description and number of weights. 1 weight is equal to 4 hrs, hence 2 weights are 8 hrs and 3 are 12 hrs respectively. This depicts which work takes how much time. Activity can be marked as milestone. They are listed in desc order of their creation making latest at the top. Users who create these activities are also logged. Activities can not be updated but can be removed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Monthly status is simple listing of activities grouped together by goals for a given month. Application would pick current month if not specified. Whereas Progress In Goals shows number of hours spent for a goal with respect to hours may be required for its completion. It also counts total number of activities logged and how many of them were milestones. This actually helps in time management of a goal considering its priority. As goal completion date can be adjusted this remains flexible too. Making it a great tool to manage your goals.</p>
